ciBracket:  Plugin for changing, deleting, yanking, etc. text between brackets and quotes.

This plugin only has two mappings:
* i: extends the normal i "inner" functionality in vim when used after operator character (c, d, y, etc.)
    * examples: ci), ci", ci}, ci', etc.
* I: exact same functionality as i "inner" except it will search forwards and backwards on the line for the desired character
    * examples: cI), cI", cI}, cI', etc.

The best way to explain is with a bunch of examples:
* the cursor location is represented by ..
* you can replace () with any of (), {}, <>, "", '' and it should work

Use case: cursor not already inside a pair of brackets
